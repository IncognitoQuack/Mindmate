For example, if you get anything less than an A+ on an exam, you might conclude 'I'm a complete failure.' This binary view of the world is unrealistic because life is rarely completely one way or the other."

You then slowly move your attention up through your foot, ankle, calf, and so on, through your entire body. The goal is not to feel anything special, but simply to be aware of the sensations that are present."

It suggests that even in the most miserable of circumstances, life can have meaning, and it is this sense of meaning that gives us the will to continue. Meaning can be found in three ways: by creating a work or doing a deed; by experiencing something or encountering someone; and by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering."

Easy (e.g., start with just a 5-minute run). 4. Satisfying (e.g., track your progress and celebrate small wins).

You can practice this by saying 'I'm having the thought that...' before stating the negative thought. For example, instead of 'I'm a failure,' you would say, 'I'm having the thought that I'm a failure.' This creates distance and reduces the thought's power."
